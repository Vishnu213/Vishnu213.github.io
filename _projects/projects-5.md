This project is a phase A feasibility study on the an innovative space mission called ARGO. Following is a brief summary of the mission and my role.

## Summary

The Asteroid Redirection with Gravity tractoring and Observation (ARGO) mission is a planetary defense initiative designed to test gravity traction techniques on a binary Near-Earth Asteroid system, specifically targeting the 162000 (1990 OS) system. This mission aims to assess the effectiveness of the gravity tractor (GT) method for mitigating potential Earth impact hazards by altering the orbit of the asteroid's secondary body. The mission involves a low-thrust transfer trajectory using ion propulsion technology, followed by a series of close-proximity operations to characterize both the primary asteroid and its moonlet.


## My contribution 

In my role, I contributed significantly to the success of this mission by developing the On-Board Data Handling (OBDH) system, defining payload requirements, and conducting an extensive literature survey. Through analyzing the payloads, I was able to provide critical input to the mission analysis team, particularly in determining the necessary trajectory distance to effectively characterize the target. My literature research offered a solid starting point for the mission's development, guiding the team to develop the mission based on previous mission results.

The OBDH system was developed keeping mind the data processing and storage needs during the mission, particularly during the characterization and proximity operations phases. Additionally, my work in defining payload requirements ensured that the instruments could meet the missionâ€™s demands, such as capturing high-resolution images for detailed observation of the asteroid system.

Throughout the project, I interacted with all subsystems, offering auxiliary support to ensure seamless integration and coordination across the team.
