## ðŸŽ“ My Research Style

- My personal preference is to involve myself in a research style that balances mathematical rigor and engineering applications.
- I am a strong believer of collaboration and teamwork. I actively participate in discussing the progress or research questions I have with my colleagues and look towards understanding their perspective.
