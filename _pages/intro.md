# Hi there! 👋

I am an aspiring researcher in the field of Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC), with a strong interest in space
technology and its applications. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. at the
<a href="https://www.ing.uniroma1.it/en" target="_blank">Department of Astronautical, Energy and Environmental Engineering</a>,
Sapienza University of Rome, funded by <strong>AVIO S.p.A.</strong>.

I am also part ofa private research group that aims at solving problems in the field of [Space Dynamics Control and System Engineering](https://sdcsgroup.mobirisesite.com/home.html){:target="\_blank"}.

Previously, I worked as a software developer in rapid prototyping of advanced driver assistance systems at the Center for Research, FIAT (present Stellantis), and as an R&D System Validation Engineer at Electrolux.

Outside work, I enjoy watching Test match cricket, playing table tennis, and trying my luck with snowboarding in the Alpine mountains.
