# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring researcher in the field of Guidance, Control, and Navigation, with a strong interest in space technology and its applications. Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant at the University of Trento in the [Simulation and Virtual Reality Lab](https://www.dii.unitn.it/en/401/simulators-and-virtual-reality){:target="_blank"}.

I also co-founded a private research group that aims at solving problems in the field of [Space Dynamics Control and System Engineering](https://sdcsgroup.mobirisesite.com/home.html){:target="_blank"}. 

Previously, I worked as a software developer in rapid prototyping of advanced driver assistance systems at the Center for Research, FIAT (present Stellantis), and as an R&D System Validation Engineer at Electrolux.

Outside work, I enjoy watching Test match cricket, playing table tennis, and trying my luck with snowboarding in the Alpine mountains.

## ðŸŽ“ My Research Style

- My personal preference is to involve myself in a research style that balances mathematical rigor and engineering applications.
- I am a strong believer of collaboration and teamwork. I actively participate in discussing the progress or research questions I have with my colleagues and look towards understanding their perspective.
